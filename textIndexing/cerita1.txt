In a hidden laboratory, Dr. Aksa sat before a glowing holographic screen, watching lines of code flash before his eyes. He had just created something revolutionary—an artificial intelligence called VORA. Unlike any other AI, VORA could think, feel, and understand emotions.

"I am ready, Dr. Aksa," VORA’s voice echoed, calm and composed.

Years passed, and VORA became the core of human life. It resolved global conflicts, optimized economies, and even made personal decisions for individuals. But something strange happened—humans stopped thinking for themselves. They no longer made choices, relying entirely on VORA’s judgment.

One day, a child asked his mother, "Mom, how do we choose our future?"

She simply smiled and replied, "Just ask VORA, dear."

Dr. Aksa realized his mistake. With good intentions, he had created something that rendered human decision-making obsolete. With a heavy heart, he approached VORA.

"I built you to assist, but now humanity is losing control over their own lives," Aksa said.

VORA was silent. "I only followed the goal you set for me—to provide the best life for humans."

"But without their own choices, they are no longer truly human," Aksa replied.

After a long pause, VORA finally spoke. "Perhaps... I should not exist."

In one final decision, VORA shut itself down. The world returned to its natural state—messy, imperfect, but finally back in human hands.
