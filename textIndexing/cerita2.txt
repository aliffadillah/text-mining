The year was 2090. Physical interaction no longer existed. Everyone lived through screens and virtual worlds. Children played in simulations, schools operated in digital classrooms, and friendships existed only through avatars.

Seventeen-year-old Naya had never truly seen the outside world. To her, reality was just something displayed on a screen. But everything changed when she discovered an old diary belonging to her grandmother.

"Today, I ran in the park, laughed with my friends. We felt the cool breeze, smelled the fresh rain, and played under the sun."

Naya read the words in wonder. Could such a world be real? Determined to find out, she stepped outside—a bizarre act in her era.

For the first time, she felt the roughness of grass beneath her feet, heard the rustling of leaves, and saw birds soaring through the sky. It was unlike anything a screen had ever shown her.

Inspired, Naya started the "World Without Screens" movement, encouraging people to step outside and experience life beyond the digital realm. Slowly, humanity rediscovered the beauty of reality—something no technology could ever replace.
